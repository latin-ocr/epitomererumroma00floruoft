the Auxiliaries of King Antiochus

or Manlius defirous of a ‘Triumph = - ’

pretended they were seen amongst
them, is doubtful. However a
Triumph is denied the Conquerar,
because the Senate did not approve
of the Occafion of the War. But
the Nation of the Gallograecians,
as the Name it elf fhews, were
mixed and adultlerated Relicks of
the Gauls that had ravaged Grem,
under the General Brennus‚' and
a terwards marching Eqstwmd,
ettled in the Middle of Asta.
W herefire as your Corn-Seeds upon
changtng their Soil degenerate, sb
that nati-ve Savageness of their’s

was sostened by the Pleafizntncst ‚

of Asta. W herefore they were
overthrown in two Battle53 though
leaving their own Gountry upon
the Enemy’s coming, they had be-‘
taken themselves into very high*
Mantains‚ which the Tolostobigi
and the Teh’lofizgi had already post
stffid themselves os. Both being

driven from thence with Slings and
Arrows‚ fierrendered themselves sor
perpetual Peace. But the {liso-
ners were the Occafion of on-
der, when they attempted their
Chains with biting, and their
Mouths, and ffred their Jaws
to one another to be squeezed to
Suffication. For the lVife of
King Orgiagon having suffered a
Rape from a Centurion, by a me-
morable Example made her Escape
rom her Keepers, and brought the
Saldier’s Head, which {he had cut

« off, to her Husband.
