the Wals o the Ciry and the
Capitol. Ῑ erffore he fled aial
retired, and withdrew himseff
into the fmhest Corner of Italy,
efter he hadleslffie City in a Man-
ner adored. Itis but a small .Mat-
ter to mention, but proper ‘enough to
prove the Adagnanimity of the Ro-
man People, that during the very

Days on which they were befieged,
the Land, which Annibal had pos-
fiffld hiufilf Ros for his Camp‚ was
to be sold at ome, and being ac-
tually exposed publickly to Sale,
found a Chapman. Annibal on the
other Side „had a Mind to imitate
their Afficranee, and put up to Sale
the Silversmiths’ Shops in-the City ;
but no Buyer was found, that you
'may perceive thos} Things were Pre-·

-nzuch Brbvery, so much Favour
too ro the Goth, since Asdrubal,
the rother of Annibal, was com-
ing with a new Army, new
Strength‚ and a new Load of
War. Without Doubt there had
been an End of the Romans, if
that Man had joined himself
with his Brother. But Claudius
Nero, with Livius Salinator, de-
feated, him too, as he was pigeb-
ing his Camp. Nero kept off'An-
nibal in the farthest Corner eff
Italy.
