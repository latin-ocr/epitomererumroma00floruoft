§The PREFACE. v-

two Authors before-mentioned, to help out my
Transsation with Words that have none to answer them
’ in the Originah without which Salvo my Engltstz must
have appeared absolutely barbarous and unintelligible.
But these the Reader will find distinguished by their
'being in adifferent Charaeter. ¹Some of the F aults to
'be found in him are, no doubt, to be charged upon
the Hands through which he has been conveyed down
to the present Tim'es3 but far the greater Part of them
are unquestionably to be placed to his own Account.
This the Reader will, Ihope, consider, and make
nge jfst {llowanfces ffr’vgndkno} thisri} th lviorse of
te ran ator, or te , canes o is ut or.

Hownvssn, with all his DefeSts‚ he is an Author
very proper· and neceffary to be read in Grammat-

Schools for the Sake of his Subjeet, and by all such c

as have a Min‘d to improve themselves in the Lan-
guage and History os the ROMANS together ; which ¹

with the Help here given them, they may do both ι

With great Ease and Pleasure 1 could indeed have
answered that Intention more fully and effectually‚ by
adding Notes upon my Author·, but those l found
must be so numerous and large to explain and cor-
re& every Thing that required it, ‘=as to swell the Book

’ - vto a Size and a Price that might not be agreeable to

the Public, and therefore Ι have judg’d it'more pro-q

f , sper to let them alone.
